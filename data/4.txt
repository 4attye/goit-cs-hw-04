Keyword searching is a common operation in text processing. To implement it efficiently across multiple files, you can load each file and scan its contents for predefined keywords. This is often done using string methods or regular expressions.
In concurrent environments, care must be taken when collecting results. For threading, you might need a `Lock` to protect shared data structures. In multiprocessing, shared data needs to be stored in a `Manager.dict` or sent through a queue.
When designing such systems, it's important to test edge cases: empty files, unreadable files, or files with non-standard encoding. Always time your operations to compare performance between threading and multiprocessing. Logging results from each file and each worker helps ensure traceability and correctness.
