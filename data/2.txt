Multiprocessing is a technique that allows you to take full advantage of multiple CPU cores. Unlike threading, multiprocessing avoids the Global Interpreter Lock, making it better suited for CPU-bound operations like complex calculations, data transformations, or simulations.
In Python, the `multiprocessing` module provides a similar interface to `threading`, but spawns separate processes with their own memory space. This separation allows true parallelism, which can drastically reduce computation time in suitable scenarios.
Proper handling of shared data between processes is important. You may need to use Queues, Pipes, or shared memory objects. Synchronization primitives like `Lock` and `Semaphore` from the multiprocessing module help prevent race conditions and ensure data consistency.
