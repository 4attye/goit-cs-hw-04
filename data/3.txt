Efficient file handling is essential in many Python programs. Reading from and writing to files must be done carefully, especially when working with multiple files or large datasets. Always remember to handle encoding and potential I/O errors using try-except blocks.
You can split large directories of files into smaller groups and assign each group to a thread or process. This speeds up processing and makes better use of available system resources. It's important to measure the execution time to compare performance between sequential, threaded, and multiprocessing approaches.
Good logging practices help identify which file caused a problem and which thread or process was responsible. Use the `logging` module to include timestamps and error messages in your logs.
