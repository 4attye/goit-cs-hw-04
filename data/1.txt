Python is a versatile and widely-used programming language. It is known for its readability, large community, and an extensive standard library. Many developers choose Python for tasks like data analysis, machine learning, web development, scripting, and automation.
Threading in Python is a built-in way to introduce concurrency, though it has limitations due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). The GIL prevents multiple native threads from executing Python bytecodes at once. As a result, threading is better suited for I/O-bound tasks such as reading and writing files or handling network requests.
Despite its limitations, Python threading can simplify logic where many operations need to wait on external resources. Understanding when to use threads and when to use processes is crucial for writing efficient concurrent applications.
